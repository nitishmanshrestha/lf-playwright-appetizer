// The paths declared in harness.config.json must match what the engine actually enforces.
//
// The engine hardcodes the framework directory — shared-rules.mjs, the hooks, and evidence.mjs all
// contain a literal `playwright/`. That is a defensible choice: this repo is single-framework, and
// deriving the rule regexes from config at runtime would add a silent-failure mode where a config
// typo stops every rule matching while everything still reports green.
//
// What is NOT defensible is declaring a path in config that nothing reads. `project.testRoot` was
// exactly that: change it, watch the generated docs update, and watch every rule keep matching the
// old directory. Config that looks authoritative but is inert invites a change that silently does
// nothing — the same failure mode as a rule declared `block` with no pattern behind it.
//
// So this test asserts the two agree. If someone changes a declared path, this fails and tells them
// the engine hardcodes it, rather than letting them believe the change took effect.
